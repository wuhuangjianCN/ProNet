## ProNet

This repository contains the code for the ProNet models described in our paper, **"Physics-AI Coupling Enables Accurate and Interpretable Air Quality Forecasts."** The `MAIN_trainAndForecast_*.py` files serve as the entry points for training the models presented in the paper. The rest of files are used to properly read the data, generate hyperparameter tuning experiments, and create, train and save the models.
